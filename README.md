# BootStrap Portfolio
## Made by Carson Sernick
#### Used with **BootStrap**, a library for making coding easy and fun. 


# How is this useful?
### Firstly, 
You can **Easily** make your own portfolio without any coding knowledge without having to dodge DMCAs and CopyRight claims by other coders. This is simple, and easy to use, and I can assure you that you will be able to make it your own. If you can't, please contact **carson@carsonsernick.info** or you can just **leave a comment**. 

# Can I use this without keeping the copyright?

## No,
You must keep the little copyright in the footer just so I can keep making projects without having my identity stolen, or projects stolen. The reason why you cannot remove it, is so that I can put these projects in my own portfolio for jobs I might want to apply to! 

#### You also must keep the bootstrap one too

# Is this free?
## Yes,
100% free. Of course, keep the copyright :) I would love to let you guys use this free and without copyright, however I also need a portfolio to keep as my own.

# How to install Bootstrap on personal projects

## This is a simple tutorial on how to use bootstrap on other projects you design!


### Installation 
First, put these two codes into your `<head>` tag
``` html 
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.11.5/dist/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-Xe+8cL9oJa6tN/veChSP7q+mnSPaj5Bcu9mPX5F5xIGE0DVittaqT5lorf0EI7Vk" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> 

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.0-beta1/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-kjU+l4N0Yf4ZOJErLsIcvOU2qSb74wXpOhqTvwVx3OElZRweTnQ6d31fXEoRD1Jy" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> 
```

## Next steps 
* Read a bit more about some important global environment settings that Bootstrap utilizes.

* Read about what’s included in Bootstrap in our contents section and the list of components that require JavaScript below.

* Need a little more power? Consider building with Bootstrap by including the source files via package manager.

* Looking to use Bootstrap as a module with `<script type="module">`? Please refer to our using Bootstrap as a module section.

## HTML5 doctype 
Bootstrap requires the use of the HTML5 doctype. Without it, you’ll see some funky and incomplete styling.


``` html <!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  ...
</html> 
```
## Responsive Meta Tag
``` html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```
# Lastly,
## Head on over to https://getbootstrap.com
The tutorial was taken from the bootstrap documentation so I have literally no credit to the tutorial.
